      <main>The story behind my website is my childhood journey with barbie.com. Before the internet I used to always play with Barbie Dolls. That is why I want the evolution section to show how they were when I played with them and how they are now. My very first internet experience was on barbie.com. I want to show the games I used to play. On barbie.com I was able to play dress up, make over, etc, which were games that I used to play with my actual dolls. I also used to play with Polly Pockets and My Scene dolls which were also integrated into barbie.com. My goal for the project is to show my childhood; the doll part and the barbie.com part. </main>
