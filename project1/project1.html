        The story behind this website is my childhood journey with barbie.com. Before the internet I used to always play with Barbie Dolls. That is why I want the evolution section to show how they were when I played with them and how they are now. My very first internet experience was on barbie.com. I want to show the games I used to play. On barbie.com I was able to play dress up, make over, etc, which were games that I used to play with my actual dolls. I also used to play with Polly Pockets and My Scene dolls which were also integrated into barbie.com. My goal for the project is to show my childhood; the doll part and the barbie.com part.

            Barbie has changed so much. When I was younger, all you could find were the skinny blond dolls. Now you can find all bodytypes, skintones, dolls with disabilities, even dolls based off of powerful women! They have become so much more inclusive and are giving young girls a better understanding and image of women. They promote realistic body images and make everygirl feel special.

            For Barbie’s 60th Anniversary they introduced a new line of dolls called the Role Model Collection. It consists of a range of powerful and inspirational women who children can look up too. There are a range of careers as well from journalist, sports stars, activists, artists and designers, scientists, movie stars, and much more. There are all women who are, well, role models.

          <p style="position: absolute; width: 395px; height: 541px; left: 440px; top: 3500px;">
            When I used to play with barbie dolls in the early 2000’s, most of the dolls were very skinny, white, and blond. They dolls were so skinny that their necks and waists were almost the same size. This gave little girls an unrealistic expectation of what they were supposed to look like. Also, it was so hard to find dolls with different skin tones which made me feel out of place. All of my friends had dolls that looked like them, but I didn’t. I felt like I was “wrong”. Now they have created dolls of different races and dolls with disabilities which makes almost all girls feel included.
